    <h1>This is BITTER LAYABOUT</h1>
    <div class="ctrdiv">
    <p>
        I'm a fan of <a href="https://berniesanders.com/">Bernie Sanders</a>, an honest politician who has been out in public working for the American people for many years. It is absurd and comical to look at the press he has received while doing this. The phrase "<a href="https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/bernie-sanders-the-bum-who-wants-your-money/">bitter layabout"</a> was thrown around during his presidential campaign in 2016. I thought it was funny and bought the domain name.<br>Do we have a liberal media in this country? I don't think so. </p>
